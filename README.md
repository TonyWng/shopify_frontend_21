# Shopify Frontend Developer Challenge - Tony Wang
Frontend Developer Challenge Submission for Shopify's Fall Internship Program by Tony Wang.  
You can check out the project here https://tonywang.dev/shopify_frontend_21/#/!  
Built using React, Redux, Redux-Persist, ReactRouter, Bootstrap, and Semantic-UI.  

  
User Guide:   
-> Begin by searching for a movie in the search bar.  
-> Detailed instructions are availble via the question icon underneath the search bar (in case you forget ;) ).  
-> Select the movies that you'd like to add to your personal list.   
-> Navigate to your personal list and nominate your favourites (Max 5).  
-> You can add/remove movies from your personal list or nominations at any time.  
-> Removing movies from your nominations list puts the movie back into your personal list.  
-> Don't worry if you accidentally close the tab, Redux-Persist stores all your selections in your browser's local storage!  
-> Have fun!
